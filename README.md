## 🚀 About the Project  
**Guardian Vision** is a pair of smart glasses integrated with a **camera**, **speaker**, and our in-house **GV AI**.  
- The AI performs **real-time object detection** and (future scope) **environment description**.  
- Output is delivered through the **speaker**, so users can receive instant feedback about their surroundings.  
- Think of it as a **personal AI co-pilot for your eyes** 👓 + 🔊.  

Built with passion (and way too much caffeine ☕) by **a team of 4 Computer Science freshmen** during our very first **University Hackathon**.

## ✨ Features  
- 🔍 **Object Detection** — recognizes everyday items in real time.  
- 🌍 **Environment Description** *(coming soon)* — “narrates” surroundings.  
- 🔊 **Audio Output** — all feedback through built-in speakers.  
- 🕶️ **Integrated Form Factor** — camera + AI + speaker in one wearable.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / Coco-SSD** (object detection model)  
- **Raspberry Pi / Edge device** *(for hardware integration)*  
- **OpenCV** (computer vision)  

---

## 🌱 Future Endeavors  
- Smarter **scene understanding** (not just object labels).  
- **Multilingual audio output**.  
- **Smaller hardware footprint** → fully self-contained glasses.  
- Potential **assistive accessibility features**.  

---

## 🙌 Acknowledgments  
- Our hackathon club (NeuralHive) mentors & peers.  
- The magic of open-source libraries.  
- And of course… **coffee + deadlines** ☕⌛.
